# OMEGA-Homepage Replica using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

This is a replica of the Omega, a Swiss luxutry watch brand, homepage created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The replica was created based on the version of May 2023 of the original website. The purpose of this project was to extract some of the components from the original website and use them to recreate a similar layout using Bootstrap.

## Live Site

This project is now hosted on Netlify. You can view the live site at [https://omega-rsp0225.netlify.app/](https://omega-rsp0225.netlify.app/).

## Components
The Omega homepage replica includes the following components:

- Navbar: The navbar component contains the Omega brand name and links to each of its products. The navbar is fixed at the top of the page.
- Main: The main section includes a carousel, Bond 60 years section, and card section. The carousel contains images of Omega products with models, the Bond 60 years section contains information about Omega's collaboration with the James Bond franchise, and the card section provides three images: Omega's latest products, men's selection, and women's selection. 
- Footer: The footer section contains links to other Omega services, such as privacty and return policy. 

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to create the Omega homepage replica:

- HTML: The structure and layout of the webpage were created using HTML.
- CSS: The styling of the webpage was implemented using CSS.
- Bootstrap: The layout, styling, and responsive design of the webpage were created using Bootstrap.

## Responsive Design
The Omega homepage replica is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. 

For the navbar section on smaller screen, the Omega brand name and hamburger icon are the only items displayed on the navbar. When the user clicks the hamburger icon, a dropdown menu appears with links to each of Omega's products.

Bootstrap's grid system was used to create a responsive layout for the main section of the webpage. The carousel, Bond 60 years section, and card section were all designed to adjust their layout based on the display size.

The footer section also uses media queries to adjust its layout based on the display size. On smaller screens, the texts in the footer are aligned center and an extra line with the United States flag appears below the text
